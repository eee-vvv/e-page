    <h1>Hi, I'm E.</h1>
    <p>I'm a fullstack developer, copyeditor, and proofreader. </p>
    <p>
      As a fullstack web developer, I make featureful, performant, and secure
      web applications. On the frontend, I mainly us React frameworks like Next.js,
      state management tools like Redux, and testing suites likes Jest and React
      Testing Library to build applications that handle data in complex ways, feel smooth,
      and are resilient and well-documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience with SQL databases and RESTful APIs (Express),
      as well as cloud alternatives like Firebase to deliver backends that efficiently and
      consistently respond to queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just finished a batch at
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com" target="_blank">the Recurse Center</a>,
      where I learned some C, started making a game in Rust using SDL2, studied
      computer science fundamentals, and made friends,
      among other things.
