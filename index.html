    <h1>Hi, I'm Evie.</h1>
    <p>I'm a fullstack software developer, copyeditor, and proofreader. </p>
    <p>
      As a developer, I make featureful, performant, and secure
      web applications. On the frontend, I mainly us React frameworks like Next.js,
      state management tools like Redux, and testing suites likes Jest and React
      Testing Library to build applications that handle data in complex ways, feel smooth,
      and are resilient and well-documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience with SQL databases and RESTful APIs (Express),
      as well as cloud alternatives like Firebase to deliver backends that efficiently and
      consistently respond to queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, finished a batch at
      <a href="https://www.recurse.com" target="_blank">the Recurse Center</a>,
      where I learned some C, *continued* learning Rust, slowly, studied
      computer science fundamentals, and made friends, among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since December of 2021, I have been working on a fullstack application for a charter school
      that allows teachers and administrators to manage schedules, meet remotely for class when necessary,
      track important data such as grades, incidents, and overall student performance. The application,
      which I can provide samples of upon request, is built using Next.js, Firebase (authentication,
      Firestore document database, and cloud functions), Redux (for the more complicated state management),
      and a few other tools and libraries for testing, form validation, etc.
