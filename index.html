    <h1>Evie's cool website!</h1>
    <p>I'm a programmer, copyeditor, and proofreader. </p>
    <p>This page is under construction while I study CS at Temple.</p>
    <p>I have built large single-page web applications that are currently live, and my focus was
      initially on JS, but I am going back to school because what *really* gets me going is OS
      and system programming.</p>
    <p>
      In adition to my development work, I am a copyeditor and proofreader, specializing in nonfiction
      that adheres to the Chicago Manual of Style. I work regularly with the MIT Press as a contractor,
      though I take new clients on a project-by-project basis.
