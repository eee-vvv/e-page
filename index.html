        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>I'm a computer science student, programmer, copyeditor, and proofreader. </p>
        <p>I have built large single-page web applications (React) that are currently live, and my focus was
            initially on JS, but I am going back to school because what *really* gets me going is OS
            and system programming.</p>
        <p>
            In adition to my development work, I am a copyeditor and proofreader, specializing in nonfiction
            that adheres to the Chicago Manual of Style. I work regularly with the MIT Press as a contractor,
            though I take new clients on a project-by-project basis.
        </p>
        <p>Find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eee-vvv">GitHub</a> and <a
                href="https://linkedin.com/in/eeevvv">LinkedIn</a>, or send me an email at work [at] evie-anderson dot
